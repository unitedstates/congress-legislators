    because it is the mechanism that the Speaker uses to maintain control of the House
    Floor. Because of the vast power wielded by the Rules Committee, its ratio has
    traditionally been weighted in favor of the majority party. The Committee provides
    the terms and conditions of debate on any measure or matter through Special Rules.
    The Committee also considers original jurisdiction measures, which commonly represent
    changes to the standing rules of the House, or measures that contain special rules,
    such as the expedited procedures in trade legislation.

  wikipedia: United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
  jurisdiction: The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations was established in 1816
    as one of the original ten standing committees of the Senate. Throughout its history,
    the committee has been instrumental in developing and influencing United States
    foreign policy, at different times supporting and opposing the policies of presidents
    and secretaries of state. The committee has considered, debated, and reported
    important treaties and legislation, ranging from the purchase of Alaska in 1867
    to the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. It also holds jurisdiction
    over all diplomatic nominations. Through these powers, the committee has helped
    shape foreign policy of broad significance, in matters of war and peace and international
    relations. Members of the committee have assisted in the negotiation of treaties,
    and at times have helped to defeat treaties they felt were not in the national
    interest.
