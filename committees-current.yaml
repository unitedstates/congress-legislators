  jurisdiction: The Committee on the Judiciary has been called the lawyer for the
    House of Representatives because of its jurisdiction over matters relating to
    the administration of justice in federal courts, administrative bodies, and law
    enforcement agencies. Its infrequent but important role in impeachment proceedings
    has also brought it much attention.
