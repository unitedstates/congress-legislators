# All of the fields we can put on a legislator,

# Run the lint.py script after editing the main
# YAML files. It will conveniently remove all of
# the comments.
#
# In separate commits, run:
#   * house_contacts.py (which will add url, address, etc. fields to House members)
#   * senate_contacts.py (likewise for Senate members)
#   * committee_membership.py (updates committee membership)
