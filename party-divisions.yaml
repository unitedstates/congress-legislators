        footnote: Organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the 1790s,
          but political factions--from which organized parties evolved--began to appear
          almost immediately after establishment of the federal government. Those
          who supported the Washington administration were referred to as "pro-administration"
          and would eventually form the Federalist party, while those in opposition
          joined the emerging (Jeffersonian) Republican party.

        footnote: The Republican party that emerged in the 1790s is also referred
          to as the Jeffersonian-Republican party or the Democratic-Republican party,
          and should not be confused with the modern (GOP) Republican party established
          in the 1850s.

        footnote: The decrease in total number of seats is due to secession of Confederate
          states. As members left the Senate to join the Confederacy, or were expelled
          for supporting the rebellion, seats were declared vacant. To establish a
          quorum with fewer members, a lower total seat number was taken into account.

        footnote: Strom Thurmond (SC) was an Independent Democrat during this Congress
          until his resignation on April 4, 1956. In November of that year he was

          Independent member listed above was Wayne Morse (OR), who changed from an
          Independent to a Democrat on February 17, 1955.

          and 45 Democratic seats, but this changed to 54-45 on July 13, 1999 when

          Independent status. On November 1, 1999, Smith announced his return to the
          Republican party, making the division once more 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.
          Following the death of Senator Paul Coverdell (R-GA) on July 18, 2000, the
          balance shifted again, to 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats, when the governor
          appointed Zell Miller, a Democrat, to fill the vacancy.
