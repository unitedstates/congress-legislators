congress-legislators
====================

Members of the United States Congress, 1789-Present, in YAML.

* legislators-current.yaml: Currently serving Members of Congress (as of last update).
* legislators-historical.yaml: Historical Members of Congress (i.e. all Members of Congress except in the current file).
* legislators-social-media.yaml: Current social media accounts for Members of Congress.

This database has been collected from a variety of sources:

* GovTrack.us (http://www.govtrack.us).
* The Congressional Biographical Directory (http://bioguide.congress.gov).
* Congressional Committees, Historical Standing Committees data set by Garrison Nelson and Charles Stewart (http://web.mit.edu/17.251/www/data_page.html).
* Martis’s “The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress”, via Rosenthal, Howard L., and Keith T. Poole. United States Congressional Roll Call Voting Records, 1789-1990 (http://voteview.com/dwnl.htm).
* The Sunlight Labs Congress API (http://services.sunlightlabs.com/docs/Sunlight_Congress_API/).

The YAML files are currently maintained by hand.

File Structure
---------------

legislators-current.yaml and legislators-historical.yaml are YAML (http://www.yaml.org/) files containing biographical information on all Members of Congress that have ever served in Congress, that is, since 1789, as well as cross-walks into other databases.

YAML is a serialization format similar in structure to JSON but typically written with one field per line. Like JSON, it allows for nested structure. Each level of nesting is indicated by indentation or a dash.

Each legislator record is grouped into four guaranteed parts: id's which relate the record to other databases, name information (first, last, etc.), biographical information (birthday, gender), and terms served in Congress. A typical record looks something like this:

	- id:
		bioguide: R000570
		thomas: '01560'
		govtrack: 400351
	  name:
		first: Paul
		middle: D.
		last: Ryan
	  bio:
		gender: M
	  terms:
	  - type: rep
		start: '2011-01-05'
		end: '2012-12-31'
		state: WI
		district: 1
		party: Republican
		url: http://www.house.gov/ryan
		address: 1233 Longworth House Office Building;  20515-4901
	  - type: rep
		start: '2009-01-06'
		end: '2010-12-22'
		state: WI
		...

An optional fifth part, other_names, will list other names the legislator has gone by officially. This is helpful in cases where a Legislator's legal name has changed. These listings will only include the name attributes which differ from the current name, and a start or end date where applicable. An excerpted example:

	- id:
		bioguide: B001228
		thomas: '01465'
		govtrack: 400039
		opensecrets: N00007068
		votesmart: 1434
	  name:
		first: Mary
		middle: Whitaker
		last: Bono Mack
	  other_names:
	  - last: Bono
		end: '2007-12-17'
	  ...

Where multiple names exist, other names are listed chronologically by end date.

The split between legislators-current.yaml and legislators-historical.yaml is somewhat arbitrary because these files may not be updated immediately when a legislator leaves office. If it matters to you, just load both files.

Legislators are listed in order of the start date of their earliest term.

A separate file legislators-social-media.yaml stores social media account information. Its structure is similar but includes different fields.

Data Dictionary
---------------

legislators-current.yaml and legislators-historical.yaml

* id
	* bioguide: The alphanumeric ID for this legislator in http://bioguide.congress.gov. Note that at one time some legislators (women who had changed their name when they got married) had two entries on the bioguide website. Only one bioguide ID is included here.
	* thomas: The numeric ID for this legislator on http://thomas.gov and http://beta.congress.gov. The ID is stored as a string with leading zeros preserved.
	* lis: The alphanumeric ID for this legislator found in Senate roll call votes (http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm).
	* govtrack: The numeric ID for this legislator on GovTrack.us.
	* opensecrets: The alphanumeric ID for this legislator on OpenSecrets.org.
	* votesmart: The numeric ID for this legislator on VoteSmart.org.
	* icpsr: The numeric ID for this legislator in Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research databases.

* name
	* first: The legislator's first name. Sometimes a first initial and period (e.g. in W. Todd Akin), in which case it is suggested to not use the first name for display purposes.
	* middle: The legislator's middle name or middle initial (with period).
	* last: The legislator's last name. Many last names include non-ASCII characters. When building search systems, it is advised to index both the raw value as well as a value with extended characters replaced with their ASCII equivalents (in Python that's: u"".join(c for c in unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', lastname) if not unicodedata.combining(c))).
	* suffix: A suffix on the legislator's name, such as "Jr." or "III".
	* nickname: The legislator's nick name when used as a common alternative to his first name.

* bio
	* birthday: The legislator's birthday, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
	* gender: The legislator's gender, either "M" or "F".
	* religion: The legislator's religion.

* terms (one entry for each election)
	* type: The type of the term. Either "sen" for senators or "rep" for representatives.
	* start: The date the term began (i.e. typically a swearing in), in YYYY-MM-DD format.
	* end: The date the term ended (because the Congress adjourned, the legislator died or resigned, etc.). For terms that end in the future, this value is typically a rough guess at the end date of the Congressional session (currently 2012-12-31). This is the last date on which the legislator served this term.
	* state: The two-letter, uppercase USPS abbreviation for the state that the legislator is serving from. See below.
	* district: For representatives, the district number they are serving from. At-large districts are district 0. In historical data, unknown district numbers are recorded as -1.
	* class: For senators, their election class (1, 2, or 3). Note that this is unrelated to seniority.
	* party: The political party of the legislator. If the legislator changed parties, it is typically the most recent party held during the term.
	* url: The official website URL of the legislator (only valid if the term is current).
	* address: The mailing address of the legislator (only valid if the term is current).

Except where noted, fields are omitted when their value is empty or unknown.

In most cases, a legislator has a single term on any given date. In some cases a legislator resigned from one chamber and was sworn in in the other chamber on the same day.

Historically, some states sending at-large representatives actually sent multiple at-large representatives. Thus, state and district may not be a unique key.

Social Media Data Dictionary
----------------------------

The social media file legislators-social-media.yaml stores current social media account information.

Each record has two sections: id and social. The id section identifies the legislator using biogiude, thomas, and govtrack IDs (where available). The social section has social media account identifiers:

* twitter: The current official Twitter handle of the legislator.
* youtube: The current official YouTube handle of the legislator.
* facebook_graph: The numeric ID of the current official Facebook Page of the legislator in the Facebook Graph.

When a legislator leaves office, their social media account information is left in this file for historical preservation.

The file is in lexical order by bioguide ID for convenience. Legislators are only present when they have one or more social media accounts known. Fields are omitted when the account is unknown.
